# COVID-19-US-Statistics
This is a project I did for submission in a Kaggle contest. This repository contain some important data manipulation, calculations and visualizations of COVID-Statistics in US.
# Car Price Prediction
This is a project I did for self-learning purpose. I have done some visualization using seaborn,matplotlib etc and then I have done Feature Engineering, Hyper parameter Tuning and used Scikit-Learn to train and test the prediction model.
# Advanced House Price Prediction
This is a Machine Learning project I did for predicting the house price based on various criterias. I have done in-depth EDA, Feature Engineering and Feature Selection, Feature Scaling,Cross Validation and Hyper Parameter Optimization. Improved model accuracy from 88 to nearly 99 per cent.
# Future Sales Forecasting using ARIMAX and Seasonal ARIMAX(Time Series Project)
I forecasted and visulized the future sales of a commodity using Time Series Analysis.
